# NO2_Prediction
## NO2_Preidction combining satellite images with GEEMAP

Abstract:
This invention proposes a geography-informed machine learning system that does not require explicit
labeling of land use or spatial structures to generate high-resolution NO2 prediction map, using a
combination of satellite data such as atmospheric monitoring, multispectral, synthetic aperture radar and
visual infrared imagery. Traditional approaches include accounting methods that require surveys of the
land along with human labeling, and ground sensor observations that are difficult to scale to larger regions
or generate fine-scale maps. This invention provides an alternative framework to rapidly generate fine-scale
NO2 maps for any region of interest without any field work or manual labeling effort.
